      "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify *clearly omitted* information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs' capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench challenges models to specify which pieces of the original context were deliberately removed, given explicit references to both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 52.4% F1-score with modest average context lengths of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend to \"gaps\" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific keys that can be attended to. Combined, our results and analysis provide a case study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman (NIAH) and task where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).\n",

      "A Generalized Bisimulation Metric of State Similarity between Markov Decision Processes: From Theoretical Propositions to Applications\n",
      "ZHENYU TAO, Wei Xu, Xiaohu You\n",
      "The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for computing state similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to multiple-MDP scenarios, such as policy transfer, remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to generalize BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of rigorous analysis of its mathematical properties has limited further theoretical progress. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) between pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with the three fundamental properties: GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and the distance bound on identical states. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyse policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation in MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than those derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.\n",

      "Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA systems remain closed and proprietary. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research community needs access to truly open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities, limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose AgentNet, a comprehensive open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet dataset, a dataset of 27K computer-use data samples spanning various operating systems, applications, and websites; (3) a pipeline that discretizes continuous actions into state-action pairs and synthesizes reflective long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning; (4) a training recipe for scalable CUA modeling; and (5) AgentNetBench, a multi-dimensional offline benchmark for faster CUA evaluation. Our AgentNet-7B, fine-tuned on AgentNet dataset, demonstrates strong performance on several CUA benchmarks, achieving a success rate of 20.1% on OSWorld and 21.1% on WindowsAgentArena. Our training recipe, particularly its advanced reasoning mechanisms and strategic data mixture, enables robust performance scaling with increased data size. Further in-depth analysis of our models also demonstrate strong cross-domain generalization and performance scaling with test-time compute. We will release the annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open foundations for further CUA research.\n",

      "As AI grows more powerful, it will increasingly shape how we understand the world. But with this influence comes the risk of amplifying misinformation and deepening social divides—especially on consequential topics like public health where factual accuracy directly impacts well-being. Scalable Oversight aims to ensure AI truthfulness by enabling humans to supervise systems that may exceed human capabilities---yet humans themselves hold different beliefs and biases that impair their judgment. We study whether AI debate can guide biased judges toward the truth by having two AI systems debate opposing sides of controversial COVID-19 factuality claims where people hold strong prior beliefs. We conduct two studies: one with human judges holding either mainstream or skeptical beliefs evaluating factuality claims through AI-assisted debate or consultancy protocols, and a second examining the same problem with personalized AI judges designed to mimic these different human belief systems. In our human study, we find that debate—where two AI advisor systems present opposing evidence-based arguments—consistently improves judgment accuracy and confidence calibration, outperforming consultancy with a single-advisor system by 10\\% overall. The improvement is most significant for judges with mainstream beliefs (+15.2\\% accuracy), though debate also helps skeptical judges who initially misjudge claims move toward accurate views (+4.7\\% accuracy). In our AI judge study, we find that AI judges with human-like personas achieve even higher accuracy (78.5\\%) than human judges (70.1\\%) and default AI judges without personas (69.8\\%), suggesting their potential for supervising frontier AI models. These findings highlight AI debate as a promising path toward scalable, bias-resilient oversight---leveraging both diverse human and AI judgments to move closer to truth in contested domains.\n",

      "Compound AI systems, comprising multiple interacting components such as LLMs, foundation models, and external tools, have demonstrated remarkable improvements compared to single models in various tasks. To ensure their effective deployment in real-world applications, aligning these systems with human preferences is crucial. However, aligning the compound system via policy optimization, unlike the alignment of a single model, is challenging for two main reasons: (i) non-differentiable interactions between components make end-to-end gradient-based optimization method inapplicable, and (ii) system-level preferences cannot be directly transformed into component-level preferences. To address these challenges, we first formulate compound AI systems as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), explicitly modeling both component interactions and the associated data flows. Building on this formulation, we introduce SysDPO, a framework that extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enable joint system-level alignment. We propose two variants, SysDPO-Direct and SysDPO-Sampling, tailored for scenarios depending on whether we construct a system-specific preference dataset. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across two applications: the joint alignment of a language model and a diffusion model, and the joint alignment of an LLM collaboration system.\n",

      "Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to project a positive brand image.However, sometimes there is a mismatch between what they say and what they do. Oil \\& gas companies, for example, are accused of ``greenwashing'' with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives.Understanding the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the goals and nature of public relation campaigns.To address this, we introduce a benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and YouTube.The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50 companies or advocacy groups across 21 countries.Our dataset is especially designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it from past text-only framing datasets.Baseline experiments show some promising results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect environmental messages with 79\\% F1 score, while our best model only achieves 46\\% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation.We also identify challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling  videos of various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds.Our dataset contributes to research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy sector.\n",

      "Liwei Jiang, Chai Yuanjun, Margaret Li, Mickel Liu, Raymond Fok, Maarten Sap, Yulia Tsvetkov, Nouha Dziri, Yejin Choi\n",
      "Language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative content, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought through repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet, scalable methods for evaluating LM output diversity remain limited—especially beyond narrow tasks like random number generation or stylized prompts. To address this gap, we introduce InfiniteChats, a large-scale dataset of 26,000 diverse, real-world open-ended user queries, along with the first comprehensive taxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to LMs, comprising six top-level categories and 17 subcategories. These queries admit a wide range of plausible answers with no single ground truth. Using InfiniteChats, we present a large-scale analysis of mode collapse in LMs, manifested as redundant outputs even for inherently open-ended queries. Our study reveals a pronounced \"Artificial Hivemind\" effect in open-ended generation, characterized by (1) intra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar responses, and (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models produce strikingly similar outputs.InfiniteChats also includes 31,250 human annotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25 independent human annotations per example. This enables fine-grained analysis of distributional preferences across annotators. Our findings show that state-of-the-art LMs, reward models, and LM judges align less with human ratings when annotators disagree or when responses are of similar quality. Overall, InfiniteChats offers the first large-scale resource for systematically studying open-endedness in LM queries, revealing critical insights to guide future research and mitigate long-term AI safety risks posed by the Artificial Hivemind.\n",

      "A Spectral Understanding of LoRA Fine-Tuning\n",
      "Reece Shuttleworth, Jacob Andreas, Antonio Torralba, Pratyusha Sharma\n",
      "Fine-tuning is a crucial paradigm for adapting pre-trained large language models to downstream tasks. Recently, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been shown to effectively fine-tune LLMs with an extreme reduction in trainable parameters. But, \\emph{are their learned solutions really equivalent?} We study how LoRA and full-finetuning change pre-trained models by analyzing the model's weight matrices through the lens of their spectral properties. We find that LoRA and full fine-tuning yield weight matrices whose singular value decompositions exhibit very different structure: weight matrices trained with LoRA have new, high-ranking singular vectors, which we call \\emph{intruder dimensions}, while those trained with full fine-tuning do not. Further, we extend the finding that LoRA forgets less than full fine-tuning and find its forgetting is vastly localized to the intruder dimension -- by causally intervening on the intruder dimensions by changing their associated singular values post-fine-tuning, we show that they cause forgetting. Moreover, scaling them down significantly improves modeling of the pre-training distribution with a minimal drop in downstream task performance. Given this, we should expect accumulating intruder dimensions to be harmful and lead to more forgetting. This will be amplified during continual learning because of sequentially fine-tuning, and we show that LoRA models do accumulate intruder dimensions here tend to perform worse in this setting, emphasizing the practicality of our findings.\n",

In many areas of science, such insights often arise from processing and visualizing data to understand its patterns. However, evaluating whether an LLM-mediated scientific workflow produces outputs conveying the correct scientific insights is challenging to evaluate and has not been addressed in past work.We introduce AstroVisBench, the first benchmark for both scientific computing and visualization in the astronomy domain.AstroVisBench judges a language model’s ability to both (1) create astronomy-specific workflows to process and analyze data and (2) visualize the results of these workflows through complex plots.Our evaluation of visualizations uses a novel LLM-as-a-judge workflow, which is validated against annotation by five professional astronomers.Using AstroVisBench we present an evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, showing a significant gap in their ability to engage in astronomy research as useful assistants.This evaluation provides a strong end-to-end evaluation for AI scientists that offers a path forward for the development of visualization-based workflows, which are central to a broad range of domains from physics to biology.\n",

      "Sarah Cen, Salil Goyal, Zaynah Javed, Ananya Karthik, Percy Liang, Daniel Ho\n",
      "Model audits play a critical role in holding AI actors accountable, and one branch of the law for which model audits are particularly salient is discrimination law. Several areas of discrimination law (including but extending beyond employment) implicate what is known as the \"less discriminatory alternatives\" (LDA) framework, in which a policy (i.e., model) is defensible if no LDA can be found with a reasonable amount of effort. Notably, the burden of proving that an LDA exists typically falls on the claimant (the party alleging discrimination) rather than the defendant. This creates a significant hurdle, as claimants would seemingly need to produce a less discriminatory model, a task requiring resources and expertise beyond most litigants. Moreover, model developers generally shield any information about the current model and training data as trade secrets. In this work, we propose a novel toolkit enabling claimants to establish the existence of LDAs even if they lack significant compute, training data, or information about the current model. Our method allows claimants to demonstrate that (obtainable) less discriminatory models exist without producing them, requiring substantially fewer resources and (potentially proprietary) information than model development. We do so by establishing a scaling law for the loss-fairness Pareto frontier (PF). As our main result, we provide a closed-form upper bound for the PF, where we focus on fairness as demographic parity as an illustrative example. Using this expression, the claimant can fit a curve to the PF in the \"low resource-information regime,\" then extrapolate the PF that applies for the (large) model being contested. The expression thus serves as a scaling law for loss-fairness PFs.\n",

      "Daniel Wurgaft, Ekdeep S Lubana, Core Francisco Park, Hidenori Tanaka, Gautam Reddy, Noah Goodman\n",
      "In-Context Learning (ICL) enables language models to adapt to novel tasks, significantly expanding their generality. Prior work has documented a rich phenomenology of ICL in specific, simplified settings—particularly the emergence of multiple solutions as task diversity and the number of observed samples increase. However, it remains unclear why these phenomena arise and whether they can be captured under a unified framework. Motivated by this, and drawing on common assumptions about simplicity bias and neural scaling, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian account that accurately predicts a Transformer’s generalization behavior in standard ICL settings—without requiring access to its parameters. Our framework views Transformer training as a process of estimating evidence for different solutions, and inference-time behavior as a posterior-weighted average over these solutions’ predictions. This perspective naturally implies a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate solutions, offering a unified explanation for prior empirical findings and yielding novel predictions. For instance, we show that sublinear sample efficiency during pretraining can induce a superlinear trend in the timescale for transitioning between solutions as task diversity scales. Together, our results advance a unified theory of ICL grounded in tradeoffs between solution loss and complexity in model space.\n",

      "Christy Li, Josep Camuñas, Jake Touchet, Jacob Andreas, Agata Lapedriza, Antonio Torralba, Tamar Shaham\n",
      "When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive its predictions? Detecting unintended use of specific visual features is critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting these dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about the unintended visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain model behavior. If inconsistencies are detected, the agent self-reflects over its findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object detector.\n",

      "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable, security and safety evaluation are crucial. While current red teaming approaches have made strides in assessing LLM vulnerabilities, they often rely heavily on human input and lack comprehensive coverage of emerging attack vectors. This paper introduces AutoRedTeamer, a novel framework for fully automated, end-to-end red teaming against LLMs. AutoRedTeamer combines a multi-agent architecture with a memory-guided attack selection mechanism to enable continuous discovery and integration of new attack vectors. The dual-agent framework consists of a red teaming agent that can operate from high-level risk categories alone to generate and execute test cases, and a strategy proposer agent that autonomously discovers and implements new attacks by analyzing recent research. This modular design allows AutoRedTeamer to adapt to emerging threats while maintaining strong performance on existing attack vectors. We demonstrate AutoRedTeamer’s effectiveness across diverse evaluation settings, achieving 20% higher attack success rates on HarmBench against Llama-3.1-70B while reducing computational costs by 46% compared to existing approaches. AutoRedTeamer also matches the diversity of human-curated benchmarks in generating test cases, providing a comprehensive, scalable, and continuously evolving framework for evaluating the security of AI systems.\n",

      "We introduce Best-of-N (BoN) Jailbreaking, a simple black-box algorithm that jailbreaks frontier AI systems across modalities. BoN Jailbreaking works by repeatedly sampling variations of a prompt with a combination of augmentations---such as random shuffling or capitalization for textual prompts---until a harmful response is elicited. We find that BoN Jailbreaking achieves high attack success rates (ASRs) on closed-source language models, such as 89% on GPT-4o and 78% on Claude 3.5 Sonnet when sampling 10,000 augmented prompts. Further, it is similarly effective at circumventing state-of-the-art open-source defenses like circuit breakers and reasoning models like o1. BoN also seamlessly extends to other modalities: it jailbreaks vision language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and audio language models (ALMs) like Gemini 1.5 Pro, using modality-specific augmentations. BoN reliably improves when we sample more augmented prompts. Across all modalities, ASR, as a function of the number of samples (N), empirically follows power-law-like behavior for many orders of magnitude. BoN Jailbreaking can also be composed with other black-box algorithms for even more effective attacks---combining BoN with an optimized prefix attack achieves up to a 35% increase in ASR. Overall, our work indicates that, despite their capability, language models are sensitive to seemingly innocuous changes to inputs, which attackers can exploit across modalities.\n",

      "Afra Amini, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell\n",
      "Estimating the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence between language models has many applications, e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), interpretability, and knowledge distillation. However, computing the exact KL divergence between two arbitrary language models is intractable. Thus, practitioners often resort to the use of sampling-based estimators. While it is easy to fashion a simple Monte Carlo (MC) estimator that provides an unbiased estimate of the KL divergence between language models, this estimator notoriously suffers from high variance, and can even result in a negative estimate of the KL divergence, a non-negative quantity. In this paper, we introduce a Rao--Blackwellized estimator that is also unbiased and provably has variance less than or equal to that of the standard Monte Carlo estimator. In an empirical study on sentiment-controlled fine-tuning, we show that our estimator provides more stable KL estimates and reduces variance substantially in practice. Additionally, we derive an analogous Rao--Blackwellized estimator of the gradient of the KL divergence, which leads to more stable training and produces models that more frequently appear on the Pareto frontier of reward vs. KL compared to the ones trained with the MC estimator of the gradient.\n",

      "Murtaza Nazir, Matthew Finlayson, John Morris, Xiang Ren, Swabha Swayamdipta\n",
      "Language model inversion seeks to recover hidden prompts using only language model outputs. This capability has implications for security and accountability in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an API-protected language model’s system message. We propose a new method – prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) – that recovers hidden prompts by gleaning clues from the model’s next-token probabilities over the course of multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace. This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving 2–3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on 16 generations steps gets 5–27% higher prompt recovery when we increase the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for logit-based inverters. Our findings suggest that next-token probabilities are a considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than previously known.\n",

ASTRA is easy to tune, requires fewer iterations than Neumann series iterations, and is more accurate than EKFAC-based approximations.

      "Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model, and subsequently Bob uses a blackbox derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from the text alone (sample setting)? We formulate this question as an independence testing problem---in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model is independent of Alice's randomized training run---and investigate it through the lens of \\textit{palimpsestic memorization} in language models: models are more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob's model derives from Alice's using test statistics that capture correlation between the output of Bob's model and the ordering of examples in Alice's training run. So long as Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, any significant correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. We develop tests for both the query and sample settings and empirically validate the power of our tests using the Pythia and OLMo model families, as well as small-scale models trained on TinyStories. In the query setting, we query Bob's model on Alice's training data and measure the correlation of its log-likelihood with the ordering of data. We show that this test is robust to common post-training practices (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization, model souping). In the sample setting, we match spans of Bob's text against Alice's training examples and correlate the likelihood of a match with the ordering of training examples. We show this test reliably attributes text to models given a few thousand tokens.

      "Reward models are central to aligning LLMs with human preferences, but they are costly to train, requiring large-scale human-labeled preference data and powerful pretrained LLM backbones. Meanwhile, the increasing availability of high-quality synthetic instruction-following datasets raises the question: can simpler, reference-based metrics serve as viable alternatives to reward models during RL-based alignment? In this paper, we show first that BLEU, a basic string-matching metric, surprisingly matches strong reward models in agreement with human preferences on general instruction-following datasets. Based on this insight, we develop BLEUBERI, a method that first identifies challenging instructions and then applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using BLEU directly as the reward function. We demonstrate that BLEUBERI-trained models are competitive with models trained via reward model-guided RL across four challenging instruction-following benchmarks and three different base language models. A human evaluation further supports that the quality of BLEUBERI model outputs is on par with those from reward model-aligned models. Moreover, BLEUBERI models generate outputs that are more factually grounded than competing methods. Overall, we show that given access to high-quality reference outputs (easily obtained via existing instruction-following datasets or synthetic data generation), string matching-based metrics are cheap yet effective proxies for reward models during alignment.\n",

      "Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single ``canonical\" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many non-canonical tokenizations using the language model vocabulary, including tokenizing by character. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of LMs to input encoded with non-canonical tokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated across 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4\\% of their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and 90.8\\% with character-level tokenization.  We find that overall stronger models tend to be more robust, and that robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs farther from the canonical form.  Motivated by these results, we identify settings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can \\textit{improve} performance, finding that character‑level segmentation improves string manipulation and code understanding tasks by up to 15\\%, and right‑aligned digit grouping enhances large‑number arithmetic by over 33\\%. Finally, we investigate the source of this robustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We provide evidence that both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of non-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings). However, base models try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical output, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall, our findings suggest that models are less committed to their tokenizer than previously believed, and highlight the promise of intervening on tokenization at inference time to boost language model performance.\n",

In this work, we provide an exact characterization of fixed-precision transformers with strict future masking and soft attention, an idealization that more closely mirrors practical implementations. We show that these models are precisely as expressive as a specific fragment of linear temporal logic that includes only a single temporal operator: the past operator. We further relate this logic to established classes in formal language theory, automata theory, and algebra, yielding a rich and unified theoretical framework for understanding transformer expressivity. Finally, we present empirical results that align closely with our theory: transformers trained on languages within their theoretical capacity generalize perfectly over lengths, while they consistently fail to generalize on languages beyond it.\n",

      "Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that provably satisfy hard constraints.However, existing constrained-decoding approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying (every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient (high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance criterion based on the LM’s likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing tasks.\n",

      "Data filtering has become a powerful tool for improving model performance while reducing computational cost. However, as large language model compute budgets continue to grow, the limited data volume provided by heavily filtered and deduplicated datasets will become a practical constraint. In efforts to better understand how to proceed, we study model performance at various compute budgets and across multiple pre-training datasets created through data filtering and deduplication. We find that, given appropriate modifications to the training recipe, repeating existing aggressively filtered datasets for up to ten epochs can outperform training on the ten times larger superset for a single epoch across multiple compute budget orders of magnitude. While this finding relies on repeating the dataset for many epochs, we also investigate repeats within these datasets at the document level. We find that not all documents within a dataset are equal, and we can create better datasets relative to a token budget by explicitly manipulating the counts of individual documents. We conclude by arguing that even as large language models scale, data filtering remains an important direction of research.\n",

      "Mixture of Experts (MoE) pretraining is more scalable than dense Transformer pretraining, because MoEs learn to route inputs to a sparse set of their feedforward parameters. However, this means that MoEs only receive a sparse backward update, leading to training instability and suboptimal performance. We present a lightweight approximation method that gives the MoE router a dense gradient update while continuing to sparsely activate its parameters. Our method, which we refer to as Default MoE, substitutes missing expert activations with default outputs consisting of an exponential moving average of expert outputs previously seen over the course of training. This allows the router to receive signals from every expert for each token, leading to significant improvements in training performance. Our Default MoE outperforms standard TopK routing in a variety of settings without requiring significant computational overhead.\n",

      "Randomness is an unavoidable part of training deep learning models, yet something that traditional training data attribution algorithms fail to rigorously account for. They ignore the fact that, due to stochasticity in the initialisation and batching, training on the same dataset can yield different models. In this paper, we address this shortcoming through introducing _distributional_ training data attribution (d-TDA), the goal of which is to predict how the distribution of model outputs (over training runs) depends upon the dataset. We demonstrate the practical significance of d-TDA in experiments, e.g. by identifying training examples that drastically change the distribution of some target measurement without necessarily changing the mean. Intriguingly, we also find that _influence functions_ (IFs), a popular but poorly-understood data attribution tool, emerge naturally from our distributional framework as the limit to unrolled differentiation – without requiring restrictive convexity assumptions. This provides a new mathematical motivation for their efficacy in deep learning, and helps to characterise their limitations.\n",

      "Do Language Models Use Their Depth Efficiently?\n",
      "Róbert Csordás, Christopher D Manning, Christopher Potts\n",
      "Modern LLMs are increasingly deep, and depth correlates with performance, albeit with diminishing returns. However, do these models use their depth efficiently? Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations that are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds of computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the residual stream of the Llama 3.1 family of models. We find: First, comparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that layers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half, with a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers in the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output predictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that models are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving many hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using their additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we train linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one. We find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other, suggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over its many layers. All this evidence suggests that deeper models are not using their depth to learn new kinds of computation, but only using the greater depth to perform more fine-grained adjustments to the residual. This may help explain why increasing scale leads to diminishing returns for stacked Transformer architectures.\n",

      "Accurately estimating *semantic* aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive generations. We introduce a **diversity-steered sampler** that discourages semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model’s proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.\n",

      "Training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to measure how training data impacts a model's predictions. While gradient-based attribution methods, such as influence functions, offer theoretical rigor, their computational costs make them impractical for large-scale applications. Representation-based attribution methods are more efficient, relying on similarity computations between examples in some representation space, but they often lack task-aware and model-specific optimization, limiting their accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose AirRep, a novel representation-based approach that enhances representation quality through task-driven optimization of a representation encoding model.Furthermore, we extend this method beyond single-sample attribution using an attention-based pooling mechanism to effectively estimate the collective influence of groups of samples.Experiments on instruction tuning of large language models demonstrate that AirRep achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art gradient-based approaches while being nearly two orders of magnitude more efficient.

In contrast, we consider spurious correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) pretrained on extensive and diverse datasets without explicit task supervision. We develop a benchmark by sourcing GPT-4o errors on real-world visual-question-answering (VQA) benchmarks, then curating a subset through LVLM-human annotation and synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify errors caused by spurious correlations. This process yields SpuriVerse, a novel benchmark comprised of 124 distinct types of spurious correlations extracted from real-world datasets, each containing 1 realistic and 10 synthetic VQA samples for a total of 1364 multiple choice questions. We evaluate 15 open and closed-source LVLMs on SpuriVerse, finding that even state-of-the-art closed-source models struggle significantly, achieving at best only 37.1\\% accuracy. Fine-tuning on synthetic examples that emphasize the spurious correlation improves performance to 78.40\\%, suggesting that training on diverse spurious patterns generalizes to unseen situations: models appear to learn to avoid \"shortcuts\" and attend to the overall image context.\n",

However, understanding quality-efficiency tradeoffs of such decisions typically requires costly pretraining, limiting architectural exploration.We present *grafting*, a simple approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize new architectures by replacing expensive operators (e.g., self-attention, MLPs) with efficient alternatives. Informed by our analysis of activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a DiT-XL/2-based testbed to study grafting’s impact on model quality. Using this testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting:replacing softmax attention with gated convolution, local, and linear attention; and MLPs with variable-width and convolutional variants. Notably, many hybrid designs achieve competitive quality (FID: 2.38–2.64 vs. 2.27 for DiT-XL/2).Next, we graft a text-to-image model (PixArt-$\\Sigma$), achieving a 43% speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures sequential computation into parallel in DiT-XL/2 via grafting, reducing model depth by 2$\\times$, achieving better quality (FID: 2.84) than other models of comparable depth.Our work shows that new diffusion model designs can be explored via grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging from operator replacement to restructuring computation.Pytorch code and grafted models are provided.\n",

      "Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5- Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from a VLM (Molmo) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether the VLM can correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.\n",

FlexOLMo employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained independently on private datasets and later integrated through a new nonparametric routing without any joint training across datasets. FlexOLMo is trained on FLEXMIX, a corpus we curate comprising seven restricted sets, either real or realistic approximations, alongside publicly available datasets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active) on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other data owners significantly benefiting from these restricted sets (an average 41% relative improvement) while allowing flexible opt-out at inference time (e.g., for users without appropriate licenses or permissions). Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by 10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data restrictions using the same training FLOPs.

      "Memorization in language models is a critical yet poorly understood phenomenon. In this work, we investigate memorization in transformer-based language models by analyzing their training dynamics over multiple epochs. We find that memorization is neither a constant accumulation of sequences nor simply dictated by the recency of exposure to these sequences. Instead, much like generalization, memorization appears to be driven by pattern recognition. Tracking memorization dynamics in mixed datasets, we observe that models memorize different sub-datasets in distinct bursts, suggesting that each subset is associated with unique underlying patterns, and that the model prefers to learn these patterns in a predictable order. While easily learnable patterns tend to support generalization on unseen data, more complex patterns do not. Furthermore, in datasets with weak or absent patterns, models may delay memorization while seeking them, a behavior we term $\\textit{overthinking}$. Our results show that the subset of sequences memorized by a model over time is not arbitrary, and give insights into the internal processes a model goes through during training.\n",

      "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual understanding but often suffer from visual hallucinations, where they generate descriptions of nonexistent objects, actions, or concepts, posing significant risks in safety-critical applications. Existing hallucination mitigation methods typically follow one of two paradigms: generation adjustment, which modifies decoding behavior to align text with visual inputs, and post-hoc verification, where external models assess and correct outputs. While effective, generation adjustment methods often rely on heuristics and lack correction mechanisms, while post-hoc verification is complicated, typically requiring multiple models and tending to reject outputs rather than refine them. In this work, we introduce REVERSE, a unified framework that integrates hallucination-aware training with on-the-fly self-verification. By leveraging a new hallucination-verification dataset containing over 1.3M semi-synthetic samples, along with a novel inference-time retrospective resampling technique, our approach enables VLMs to both detect hallucinations during generation and dynamically revise those hallucinations.

In this work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework (GeoAda) that enables flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks without modifying the original model architecture.  GeoAda introduces a structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected base model layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model’s geometric consistency while mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of \\method across diverse geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics, molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical results show that  GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting.\n",

We represent multi-LLM systems as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of LLMs with topological message passing for collaborative generation. Given a pool of LLM experts and a utility function, Heterogeneous Swarms employs two iterative steps: role-step and weight-step. For role-step, we interpret model roles as learning a DAG that specifies the flow of inputs and outputs between LLMs. Starting from a swarm of random continuous adjacency matrices, we decode them into discrete DAGs, call the LLMs in topological order, evaluate on the utility function (e.g. accuracy on a task), and optimize the adjacency matrices with particle swarm optimization based on the utility score. For weight-step, we assess the contribution of individual LLMs in the multi-LLM systems and optimize model weights with swarm intelligence. We propose JFK-score to quantify the individual contribution of each LLM in the best-found DAG of the role-step, then optimize model weights with particle swarm optimization based on the JFK-score. Experiments demonstrate that Heterogeneous Swarms outperforms 17 role- and/or weight-based baselines by 18.5% on average across 12 tasks. Further analysis reveals that Heterogeneous Swarms discovers multi-LLM systems with heterogeneous model roles and substantial collaborative gains, and benefits from the diversity of language models.\n",

Our theoretical reveals a unique phenomenon: that $\\sigma$ can greatly impact learning imbalances. This result sharply contrasts with previous research on supervised and weakly supervised learning, which only studies learning imbalances under data imbalances. On the practical side, we introduce a technique for estimating the marginal of the hidden gold labels using weakly supervised data. Then, we introduce algorithms that mitigate imbalances at training and testing time by treating the marginal of the hidden labels as a constraint.

Our framework, formulated as a conditional density estimation problem, inherently defines a target distribution with improved properties, compelling the generative model to produce enhanced and diverse designs without relying on auxiliary predictors. GPE offers a simple, scalable, and end-to-end approach for design optimization. It is modality-agnostic and can be seamless integrated across diverse generative architectures and losses.We show our model achieves competitive empirical results in standard protein fitness optimization _in silico_ benchmarks.

      "Steering methods for language models (LMs) seek to provide fine-grained and interpretable control over model generations by variously changing model inputs, weights, or representations to adjust behavior. Recent work has shown that adjusting weights or representations is often less effective than steering by prompting, for instance when wanting to introduce or suppress a particular concept. We demonstrate how to improve representation steering via our new Reference-free Preference Steering (RePS), a bidirectional preference-optimization objective that jointly does concept steering and suppression. We train three parameterizations of RePS and evaluate them on AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark. On Gemma models with sizes ranging from 2B to 27B, RePS outperforms all existing steering methods trained with a language modeling objective and substantially narrows the gap with prompting -- while promoting interpretability and minimizing parameter count. In suppression, RePS matches the language-modeling objective on Gemma-2 and outperforms it on the larger Gemma-3 variants while remaining resilient to prompt-based jailbreaking attacks that defeat prompting. Overall, our results suggest that RePS provides an interpretable and robust alternative to prompting for both steering and suppression.\n",

We present KGGen, a novel text-to-knowledge-graph generator that uses language models to extract high-quality graphs from plain text with a novel entity resolution approach that clusters related entities, significantly reducing the sparsity problem that plagues existing extractors. Unlike other KG generators, KGGen clusters and deduplicates related entities to reduce sparsity in extracted KGs. Along with KGGen, we release Measure of Information in Nodes and Edges (MINE), the first benchmark to test an extractor's ability to produce a useful KG from plain text.  We benchmark our new tool against leading existing generators such as Microsoft's GraphRAG; we achieve comparable retrieval accuracy on the generated graphs and better information retention.  Moreover, our graphs exhibit more concise and generalizable entities and relations.  KGGen is available as a Python library (pip install [redacted]), making it accessible to everyone.\n",

      "Andreas Opedal, Yanick Zengaffinen, Haruki Shirakami, Clemente Pasti, Mrinmaya Sachan, Abulhair Saparov, Ryan Cotterell, Bernhard Schölkopf\n",
      "Much recent work has focused on how language models can be adapted to solve reasoning problems through search methods. To solve a task in a realistic setting, an agent often needs to search over many facts, many of which are irrelevant to said task, and do so in an efficient manner. In this paper, we investigate how language models perform in such a setting, focusing on whether they can successfully prove theorems, if they take unnecessary proof steps, and which form of search algorithm they employ. We consider a proof system for GSM-like arithmetic reasoning problems and evaluate language models on problems with a large space of arithmetic facts that are irrelevant to the task. Beyond answer accuracy, we also verify the full proof generated by the language model. This is done by measuring how well the language model output matches the most efficient ground-truth proof, which is a provably unique normal form under the proof system. We find that both standard and reasoning-oriented models perform worse on problems that have been augmented with irrelevant facts of different types. Even when they correctly prove the goal theorem, they are often inefficient, using more test-time compute than necessary. Our analysis suggests that their algorithm is closer to depth-first than to breadth-first search, and that they use information from the query as a heuristic, but that this heuristic still sometimes leads them down irrelevant paths.\n",

      "A long-standing goal in AI is to develop agents capable of solving diverse tasks across a range of environments, including those never seen during training. Two dominant paradigms address this challenge: (i) reinforcement learning (RL), which learns policies via trial and error, and (ii) optimal control, which plans actions using a known or learned dynamics model. However, their comparative strengths in the offline setting—where agents must learn from reward-free trajectories—remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically evaluate RL and control-based methods on a suite of navigation tasks, using offline datasets of varying quality. On the RL side, we consider goal-conditioned and zero-shot approaches. On the control side, we train a latent dynamics model using the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and employ it for planning. We investigate how factors such as data diversity, trajectory quality, and environment variability influence the performance of these approaches. Our findings reveal that model-free RL excels when abundant, high-quality data is available, while model-based planning demonstrates superior generalization to novel layouts, better trajectory stitching, and greater data efficiency. Notably, planning with a latent dynamics model proves to be a strong approach for handling suboptimal offline data and adapting to diverse environment configurations.\n",

However, the efficient learnability of Transformers from data has remained an open question.  Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-time learnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) for single-layer Transformers with linear attention.  We show that learning the optimal multi head linear attention can be recast as finding the optimal kernel predictor in a suitably defined RKHS.  Moving to generalization, we construct an algorithm that, given a dataset, checks in polynomial time whether the set of best fit multi head linear attention networks on this data all perform an identical computation--a powerful notion for out of distribution generalization.  We empirically validate our theoretical findings on several canonical tasks: learning random linear attention networks, key--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata.

      "Segmentation models can recognize a pre-defined set of objects in images. However, segmentation models capable of \"reasoning\" over complex user queries that implicitly refer to multiple objects of interest remain underexplored, especially in the geospatial domain. Recent advances in \"reasoning segmentation\"---generating segmentation masks from complex, implicit query text---demonstrate the potential of vision-language models (VLMs) to reason across an open domain of objects. Yet, our experiments reveal that these models struggle when applied to the unique challenges of remote-sensing imagery. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset which consists of: GRES, a curated geospatial reasoning-segmentation dataset with 27,615 annotations across 9,205 images, and PreGRES, a collection of existing datasets to make up a large-scale multimodal pretraining corpus with over 1M question-answer pairs across 119,279 images. We propose an initial benchmark model, LISAt, a VLM for geospatial analysis that can describe complex remote-sensing scenes, answer detailed queries, and segment objects based on natural-language prompts. LISAt establishes a strong initial geospatial benchmark, outperforming prior foundation models such as RS-GPT4V by 10.04\\% (BLEU-4) on visual description tasks and surpassing open-domain models on geospatial reasoning segmentation by 143.36\\% (gIoU).

      "We present LMFusion, a framework for empowering pretrained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multimodal generative capabilities, enabling them to understand and generate both text and images in arbitrary sequences. LMFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LMFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that, LMFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development.\n",

      "Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought reasoning—such as DeepSeek-R1—have achieved impressive results on Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking. To systematically probe these limitations, we introduce MathOOD, a controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of out-of-distribution generalization inspired by Boden’s typology of creativity: (1) Exploratory—applying known problem-solving skills to more complex instances within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional— combining distinct reasoning skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3) Transformative—adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively.  MathOOD consists of programmatically generated training–test pairs derived from templated problem generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical methods. We evaluate top-tiered LLMs and observe sharp performance degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization remains limited and transformative reasoning shows 0 improvement. By isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, MathOOD lays the groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond mechanical proficiency.\n",

      "While text-to-image models like GPT-4o-Image and FLUX are rapidly proliferating, they often encounter challenges such as hallucination, bias, and the production of unsafe, low-quality output. To effectively address these issues, it is crucial to align these models with desired behaviors based on feedback from a multimodal judge. Despite their significance, current multimodal judges frequently undergo inadequate evaluation of their capabilities and limitations, potentially leading to misalignment and unsafe fine-tuning outcomes. To address this issue, we introduce MJ-Bench, a novel benchmark which incorporates a comprehensive preference dataset to evaluate multimodal judges in providing feedback for image generation models across six key perspectives: alignment, safety, image quality, bias, composition, and visualization. Specifically, we evaluate a large variety of multimodal judges including smaller-sized CLIP-based scoring models, open-source VLMs, and close-source VLMs on each decomposed subcategory of our preference dataset. Experiments reveal that close-source VLMs generally provide better feedback, with GPT-4o outperforming other judges in average. Compared with open-source VLMs, smaller-sized scoring models can provide better feedback regarding text-image alignment and image quality, while VLMs provide more accurate feedback regarding safety and generation bias due to their stronger reasoning capabilities. Further studies in feedback scale reveal that VLM judges can generally provide more accurate and stable feedback in natural language than numerical scales. Notably, human evaluations on end-to-end and fine-tuned models using separate feedback from these multimodal judges provide similar conclusions, further confirming the effectiveness of MJ-Bench.\n",

      "Current image generation methods are based on a two-stage training approach. In stage 1, an auto-encoder is trained to compress an image into a latent space; in stage 2, a generative model is trained to learn a distribution over that latent space. This reveals a fundamental trade-off, do we compress more aggressively to make the latent distribution easier for the stage 2 model to learn even if it makes reconstruction worse? We study this problem in the context of discrete, auto-regressive image generation. Through the lens of scaling laws, we show that smaller stage 2 models can benefit from more compressed stage 1 latents even if reconstruction performance worsens, demonstrating that generation modeling capacity plays a role in this trade-off. Diving deeper, we rigorously study the connection between compute scaling and the stage 1 rate-distortion trade-off. Next, we introduce Causally Regularized Tokenization (CRT), which uses knowledge of the stage 2 generation modeling procedure to embed useful inductive biases in stage 1 latents. This regularization improves stage 2 generation performance better by making the tokens easier to model without affecting the stage 1 compression rate and marginally affecting distortion: we are able to improve compute efficiency 2-3$\\times$ over baseline. Finally, we use CRT with further optimizations to the visual tokenizer setup to result in a generative pipeline that matches LlamaGen-3B generation performance (2.18 FID) with half the tokens per image (256 vs. 576) and a fourth the total model parameters (775M vs. 3.1B) while using the same architecture and inference procedure.\n",

      "Learning robot control policies from human videos is a promising direction for scaling up robot learning. However, how to extract action knowledge (or action representations) from videos for policy learning remains a key challenge. Existing action representations such as video frames, pixelflow, and pointcloud flow have inherent limitations such as modeling complexity or loss of information. In this paper, we propose to use object-centric 3D motion field to represent actions for robot learning from human videos, and present a novel framework for extracting this representation from videos for zero-shot control. We introduce two novel components. First, a novel training pipeline for training a ``denoising'' 3D motion field estimator to extract fine object 3D motions from human videos with noisy depth robustly. Second, a dense object-centric 3D motion field prediction architecture that favors both cross-embodiment transfer and policy generalization to background. We evaluate the system in real world setups. Experiments show that our method reduces 3D motion estimation error by over 50% compared to the latest method, achieve 55% average success rate in diverse tasks where prior approaches fail ($\\lesssim 10$\\%), and can even acquire fine-grained manipulation skills like insertion.\n",

      "On the Entropy Calibration of Language Models\n",
      "Steven Cao, Gregory Valiant, Percy Liang\n",
      "We study the problem of entropy calibration, which asks whether a language model's entropy over generations matches its log loss on human text. Past work found that models are miscalibrated, with entropy per step increasing as generations grow longer. This entropy growth is accompanied by a degradation in text quality, and fixing error accumulation has been the subject of many papers, which propose distribution truncation methods to trade diversity for quality. In this paper, we ask: is miscalibration likely to improve with scale, and is it theoretically possible to calibrate without tradeoffs? To build intuition, we first study a simplified theoretical setting to characterize the scaling behavior of miscalibration with respect to dataset size. We find that the scaling behavior depends on the power law exponent of the data distribution — in particular, for a power law exponent close to 1, the scaling exponent is close to 0, meaning that miscalibration improves very slowly with scale. Next, we measure miscalibration empirically in language models ranging from 0.5B to 70B parameters. We find that the observed scaling behavior is similar to what is predicted by the simplified setting: our fitted scaling exponents for text are close to 0, meaning that larger models accumulate error at a similar rate as smaller ones. This scaling (or, lack thereof) provides one explanation of why we sample from larger models with similar amounts of truncation as smaller models, even though the larger models are of higher quality. However, truncation is not a satisfying solution because it comes at the cost of increased log loss. In theory, is it even possible to reduce entropy while preserving log loss? We prove that it is possible, if we assume access to a black box which can fit models on the future entropy of text prefixes and attain low test error.\n",

      "Model diffing is the study of how fine-tuning changes a model's representations and internal algorithms. Many behaviors of interest are introduced during fine-tuning, and model diffing offers a promising lens to interpret such behaviors. Crosscoders are a recent model diffing method that learns a shared dictionary of interpretable concepts represented as latent directions in both the base and fine-tuned models, allowing us to track how concepts shift or emerge during fine-tuning. Notably, prior work has observed concepts with no direction in the base model, and it was hypothesized that these model-specific latents were concepts introduced during fine-tuning.However, we identify two issues which stem from the crosscoders L1 training loss that can misattribute concepts as unique to the fine-tuned model, when they really exist in both models. We develop Latent Scaling to flag these issues by more accurately measuring each latent's presence across models.In experiments comparing Gemma 2 2B base and chat models, we observe that the standard crosscoder suffers heavily from these issues. Building on these insights, we train a crosscoder with BatchTopK loss  and show that it substantially mitigates these issues, finding more genuinely chat-specific and highly interpretable concepts. We recommend practitioners adopt similar techniques.Using the BatchTopK crosscoder, we successfully identify a set of chat-specific latents that are both interpretable and causally effective, representing concepts such as false information and personal question, along with multiple refusal-related latents that show nuanced preferences for different refusal triggers. Overall, our work advances best practices for the crosscoder-based methodology for model diffing and demonstrates that it can provide concrete insights into how chat-tuning modifies model behavior.\n",

Despite over-refusal having been observed in practice, there is no large-scale benchmark that systematically evaluates this phenomenon for T2I models. In this paper, we present an automatic workflow to construct synthetic evaluation data, resulting in OVERT (\\textbf{OVE}r-\\textbf{R}efusal evaluation on \\textbf{T}ext-to-image models), the first large-scale benchmark for assessing over-refusal behaviors in T2I models. OVERT includes 4,600 seemingly harmful but benign prompts across nine safety-related categories, along with 1,785 genuinely harmful prompts (OVERT-unsafe) to evaluate the safety–utility trade-off. Using OVERT, we evaluate several leading T2I models and find that over-refusal is a widespread issue across various categories (Figure 1), underscoring the need for further research to enhance the safety alignment of T2I models without compromising their functionality. As a preliminary attempt to reduce over-refusal, we explore prompt rewriting; however, we find it often compromises faithfulness to the meaning of the original prompts.Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our generation framework in accommodating diverse safety requirements by generating customized evaluation data adapting to user-defined policies.\n",

      "Positional Fragility in LLMs: How Offset Effects Reshape Our Understanding of Memorization Risks\n",
      "Yixuan Xu, Antoine Bosselut, Imanol Schlag\n",
      "Large language models are known to memorize parts of their training data, posing risk of copyright violations. To systematically examine this risk, we pretrain language models (1B/3B/8B) from scratch on 83B tokens, mixing web-scale data with public domain books used to simulate copyrighted content at controlled frequencies at lengths at least ten times longer than prior work. We thereby identified the offset effect, a phenomenon characterized by two key findings: (1) verbatim memorization is most strongly triggered by short prefixes drawn from the beginning of the context window, with memorization decreasing counterintuitively as prefix length increases; and (2) a sharp decline in verbatim recall when prefix begins offset from the initial tokens of the context window. We attribute this to positional fragility: models rely disproportionately on the earliest tokens in their context window as retrieval anchors, making them sensitive to even slight shifts. We further observe that when the model fails to retrieve memorized content, it often produces degenerated text. Leveraging these findings, we show that shifting sensitive data deeper into the context window suppresses both extractable memorization and degeneration. Our results suggest that positional offset is a critical and previously overlooked axis for evaluating memorization risks, since prior work implicitly assumed uniformity by probing only from the beginning of training sequences.\n",

      "A central challenge in modern language models (LMs) is intrinsic hallucination: the generation of information that is plausible but unsubstantiated relative to input context. To study this problem, we propose Precise Information Control (PIC), a new task formulation that requires models to generate long-form outputs grounded in a provided set of input statements, without adding any unsupported ones. While intrinsic hallucination is commonly evaluated as a binary judgment, we instantiate PIC at the level of short, self-contained statements known as verifiable claims. PIC includes a full setting, which tests a model’s ability to comprehensively include all input claims, and a partial setting, which requires the model to selectively include only relevant claims. We present PIC-Bench, a benchmark of eight long-form generation tasks (e.g., summarization, biography generation) adapted to the PIC setting, where LMs are supplied with well-formed, verifiable input claims. We evaluate a range of open and proprietary models on PIC-Bench; surprisingly, state-of-the-art LMs still intrinsically hallucinate in over 70% of outputs. To alleviate this lack of faithfulness, we introduce a post-training framework, using a weakly supervised preference data construction method, to train an 8B PIC-LM with stronger PIC ability---notably improving from 69.1% to 89.7% F1 in the full setting. When integrated into end-to-end generation pipelines, PIC-LM yields better end-task factual accuracy, improving by 14% in exact match recall on ambiguous QA with retrieval, and by 21% in precision on factual verification tasks, underscoring the broad potential of precisely grounded generation.\n",

      "Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun’s surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of stochastic, partially observable dynamical systems, with application to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When this inductive bias is integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves the rollout stability.\n",

      "Offline multi-objective optimization aims to identify Pareto-optimal solutions given a dataset of designs and their objective values. In this work, we propose a preference-guided diffusion model that generates Pareto-optimal designs by leveraging a classifier-based guidance mechanism. Our guidance classifier is a preference model trained to predict the probability that one design dominates another, directing the diffusion model toward optimal regions of the design space. Crucially, this preference model generalizes beyond the training distribution, enabling the discovery of Pareto-optimal solutions outside the observed dataset. We introduce a novel diversity-aware preference guidance, augmenting Pareto dominance preference with diversity criteria. This ensures that generated solutions are optimal and well-distributed across the objective space, a capability absent in prior generative methods for offline multi-objective optimization. We evaluate our approach on various continuous offline multi-objective optimization tasks and find that it consistently outperforms other inverse/generative approaches while remaining competitive with forward/surrogate-based optimization methods. Our results highlight the effectiveness of classifier-guided diffusion models in generating diverse and high-quality solutions that approximate the Pareto front well.\n",

      "Data diversity is crucial for training a strong language model. Yet metrics of diversity often diverge from this goal, measuring variations in heuristic features—like n-grams or embeddings—that are detached from how the model actually performs on a target task. This motivates us to ask: *Can we redefine data diversity—beyond measuring variations in heuristic features—in a way that better predicts model generalization?* Through large-scale empirical analyses spanning over 300 training runs, carefully controlled for data scale and quality, we show that data diversity can be a strong predictor of generalization in LLM reasoning—as measured by average model performance on unseen out-of-distribution benchmarks. We introduce **G-Vendi**, a metric that quantifies diversity via the entropy of model-induced loss gradients. G-Vendi scales to million-sample datasets and yet consistently outperforms heuristic alternatives, achieving strong correlation ($\\text{Spearman's } \\rho \\approx 0.9$) with out-of-distribution (OOD) performance across both natural language inference (NLI) and math reasoning tasks. Building on this insight, we present **Prismatic Synthesis**, a framework for generating diverse synthetic data by targeting underrepresented regions in gradient space. Experimental results show that Prismatic Synthesis consistently improves model performance as we scale synthetic data—not just on in-distribution test but across unseen, out-of-distribution benchmarks—significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models in both domains. For example, PrismMath-7B, our model distilled from a 32B LLM without human verification, outperforms R1-Distill-Qwen-7B—trained on proprietary data generated by 671B R1—on 6 out of 7 challenging math benchmarks.\n",

We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the $k$-privacy value of a text—the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables.  The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final $k$-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the $k$-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.\n",

      "Reinforcement Learning (RL) traditionally relies on scalar reward signals, limiting its ability to leverage the rich semantic knowledge often available in real-world tasks. In contrast, humans learn efficiently by combining numerical feedback with language, prior knowledge, and common sense. We introduce Prompted Policy Search (ProPS), a novel RL method that unifies numerical and linguistic reasoning within a single framework. Unlike prior work that augments existing RL components with language, ProPS places a large language model (LLM) at the center of the policy optimization loop—directly proposing policy updates based on both reward feedback and natural language input. We show that LLMs can perform numerical optimization in-context, and that incorporating semantic signals, such as goals, constraints, and strategy hints can lead to more informed exploration and sample-efficient learning. ProPS is evaluated across 15 Gymnasium tasks, spanning classic control, Atari games, and MuJoCo environments, and compared to seven widely-adopted RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC, TRPO). It outperforms all baselines on 8 out of 15 tasks and demonstrates substantial gains when provided with domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of unifying semantics and numerics for transparent, generalizable, and human-aligned reinforcement learning.\n",

      "Recent advances in reasoning-centric language models have highlighted reinforcement learning (RL) as a promising method for aligning models with verifiable rewards. However, it remains contentious whether RL truly expands a model’s reasoning capabilities or merely amplifies high-reward outputs already latent in the base model’s distribution, and whether continually scaling up RL compute reliably leads to improved reasoning performance. In this work, we challenge prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that prolonged RL (ProRL) training can uncover novel reasoning strategies that are inaccessible to base models, even under extensive sampling. We introduce ProRL, a novel training methodology that incorporates KL divergence control, reference policy resetting, and a diverse suite of tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals that RL-trained models consistently outperform base models across a wide range of pass@$k$ evaluations, including scenarios where base models fail entirely regardless of the number of attempts. We further show that reasoning boundary improvements correlates strongly with task competence of base model and training duration, suggesting that RL can explore and populate new regions of solution space over time.  These findings offer new insights into the conditions under which RL meaningfully expands reasoning boundaries in language models and establish a foundation for future work on long-horizon RL for reasoning. We will release model weights and data to support further research.\n",

      "Large language models often possess latent capabilities that lie dormant unless explicitly elicited, or surfaced, through fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Predicting, assessing, and understanding these latent capabilities pose significant challenges in the development of effective, safe AI systems. In this work, we recast elicitation as an information-constrained fine-tuning problem and empirically characterize an upper bound on the minimal number of parameters needed to reach a certain task accuracy. We find that training as few as 10–100 randomly chosen parameters---several orders of magnitude fewer than state-of-the-art parameter-efficient methods---can recover up to 50\\% of the performance gap between pretrained-only and fully fine-tuned models, and 1,000s to 10,000s of parameters can recover 95\\% of this performance gap. We show that a logistic curve fits the relationship between the number of trained parameters and the fraction of the performance gap recovered. To help explain this behavior, we consider a simplified picture of elicitation via fine-tuning where each trainable parameter serves as an encoding mechanism for accessing task-specific knowledge. We observe a relationship between the number of trained parameters and the effectiveness in eliciting latent capabilities, offering a potential route to distinguish elicitation from teaching.\n",

      "Despite their strengths, large language models (LLMs) often fail to communicate their confidence accurately, making it difficult to assess when they might be wrong and limiting their reliability. In this work, we demonstrate that reasoning models—LLMs that engage in extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning—exhibit superior performance not only in problem-solving but also in accurately expressing their confidence. Specifically, we benchmark six reasoning models across six datasets and find that they achieve strictly better confidence calibration than their non-reasoning counterparts in 33 out of the 36 settings. Our detailed analysis reveal that these gains in calibration stem from the slow thinking behaviors of reasoning models—such as exploring alternative approaches and backtracking—which enable them to adjust their confidence dynamically throughout their CoT, making it progressively more accurate. In particular, we find that reasoning models become increasingly better calibrated as their CoT unfolds, a trend not observed in non-reasoning models. Moreover, removing slow thinking behaviors from the CoT leads to a significant drop in calibration. Lastly, we show that these gains are not exclusive to reasoning models—non-reasoning models also benefit when guided to perform slow thinking via in-context learning.\n",

      "To avoid bad language model (LM) outputs, there are many alignment approaches (e.g., RLHF, DPO). Ideally, we would like our LM to have zero probability of undesirable outputs. Standard reinforcement learning (RL) would achieve this at optimality (if unregularized). However, in practice, there may be a tradeoff between methods focusing on the expected reward (standard RL) and methods explicitly focused on reducing the probability of undesired outputs. Our goal is to improve this tradeoff, reducing the probability of bad outputs as much as possible, while maintaining performance on expected reward. To do this, we introduce RePULSe, a new training method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those outputs' probability. We run experiments to test whether our method provides better reduction of the probability of bad outputs and adversarial robustness, at minimal cost to expected reward, compared to standard RL alignment approaches and other alternatives.\n",

We propose a novel retrieval-embedded generation framework that allows a large language model to quote multimodal resources while maintaining a coherent narrative. Our proposed REGen system first generates the output story script with quote placeholders using a finetuned large language model, and then uses a novel retrieval model to replace the quote placeholders by selecting a video clip that best supports the narrative from a pool of candidate quotable video clips. We examine the proposed method on the task of documentary teaser generation, where short interview insertions are commonly used to support the narrative of a documentary. Our objective evaluations show that the proposed method can effectively insert short video clips while maintaining a coherent narrative.

We further explore optimal visual state representations, finding natural language effective generally, while structured formats prove crucial for tasks demanding high precision or understanding of low-level visual details. To specifically reinforce visual state reasoning, we introduce Visual Reasoning RL, which incorporates two key techniques: a turn-level visual reasoning reward to supervise reasoning accuracy, and Bi-Level General Advantage Estimation (GAE) that estimates advantages at both turn and token levels. This comprehensive approach consistently improves task performance and reasoning quality.

      "Transformers require inputs to be represented as one-dimensional sequences, and in vision, this typically involves flattening images using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we propose _REOrder_, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space. _REOrder_ improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to $3.01\\%$ and Functional Map of the World by $13.35\\%$.

      "Recent studies have shown LLMs possess \\textit{some} ability to improve their responses when given external feedback.However, it remains unclear how effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback.  In an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would expect them to \\emph{fully} integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers to correct ones.In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator with access to \\textit{near-complete} ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback, after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse range of tasks, including mathematical reasoning, knowledge reasoning, complex scientific reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language models as solver and feedback generator. Surprisingly, even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term RIGID THINKING. To mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help models achieve target performance. We perform a rigorous exploration of potential causes of RIGID THINKING, ruling out factors such as model overconfidence and data familiarity.\n",

Notably, retrieval-augmented agents built on aligned LLMs often behave more unsafely than uncensored models without retrieval.

      "Best-of-N selection is a key technique for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through increased test-time computation. Current state-of-the-art methods often employ computationally intensive reward models for response evaluation and selection. Reward-free alternatives, like self-consistency and universal self-consistency, are limited in their ability to handle open-ended generation tasks or scale effectively. To address these limitations, we propose self-certainty, a novel and efficient metric that leverages the inherent probability distribution of LLM outputs to estimate response quality without requiring external reward models. We hypothesize that higher distributional self-certainty, aggregated across multiple samples, correlates with improved response accuracy, as it reflects greater confidence in the generated output. Through extensive experiments on various reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that self-certainty (1) scales effectively with increasing sample size $N$, akin to reward models but without the computational overhead; (2) complements chain-of-thought, improving reasoning performance beyond greedy decoding; and (3) generalizes to open-ended tasks where traditional self-consistency methods fall short.

Hence, we pose scalability as a crucial requirement for fingerprinting schemes. We experiment with fingerprint design at a scale significantly larger than previously considered,and introduce a new method, dubbed Perinucleus sampling, to generate scalable, persistent, and harmless fingerprints. We demonstrate that this scheme can add 24,576 fingerprints to a Llama-3.1-8B model---two orders of magnitude more than existing schemes---without degrading the model's utility.

      "Existing benchmarks for evaluating the security risks and capabilities (e.g., vulnerability detection) of code-generating large language models (LLMs) face several key limitations:(1) limited coverage of risk and capabilities;(2) reliance on static evaluation metrics such as LLM judgments or rule-based detection, which lack the precision of dynamic analysis; and(3) a trade-off between data quality and benchmark scale.To address these challenges, we introduce a general and scalable benchmark construction framework that begins with manually validated, high-quality seed examples and expands them via targeted mutations.Each mutated sample retains the seed’s security semantics while providing diverse, unseen instances. The resulting benchmark bundles every artifact required for dynamic evaluation, including prompts, vulnerable and patched code, test cases, and ground-truth proofs of concept, enabling rigorous measurement of insecure coding, vulnerability detection, and patch generation. Applying this framework to Python, C/C++, and Java, we build SECCODEPLT, a dataset of more than 5.9k samples spanning 44 CWE-based risk categories and three security capabilities. Compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks, SECCODEPLT offers broader coverage, higher data fidelity, and substantially greater scale. We use SECCODEPLT to evaluate leading code-generation LLMs and agents, revealing their strengths and weaknesses in both generating secure code and identifying or fixing vulnerabilities.We provide our code in \\url{https://github.com/ucsb-mlsec/SecCodePLT}, data in \\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/secmlr/SecCodePLT}\n",

      "David Heineman, Valentin Hofmann, Ian Magnusson, Yuling Gu, Noah Smith, Hanna Hajishirzi, Kyle Lo, Jesse Dodge\n",
      "Developing large language models is expensive and often involves making decisions with small experiments, typically by evaluating on large, multi-task evaluation suites. In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark more reliable and useful for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality evaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in current benchmarks: signal, a benchmark’s ability to separate better models from worse models, and noise, a benchmark’s sensitivity to random variability between training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better signal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale, and those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error.  These results suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful benchmarks, so we introduce four interventions designed to directly affect signal or noise.  For example, we propose that switching to a  metric that has better signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better reliability and scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy benchmarks such that they have better signal-to-noise ratio leads to more reliable evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We conclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which existing benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise.  We use 30 benchmarks for these experiments, and 465 open-weight language models from 60M to 32B parameters, resulting in a new, publicly available dataset of 50K evaluation benchmark results, totaling 200M instances.\n",

      "Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions. However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi, covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.\n",

      "Tintin Jiang, Wenxuan Ding, Shangbin Feng, Greg Durrett, Yulia Tsvetkov\n",
      "We propose Sparta Alignment, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a 'sparta tribe' to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one, and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration. Sparta Alignment enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sparta Alignment outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0\\% average improvement. Further analysis reveals that Sparta Alignment generalizes more effectively to unseen tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce more logical, direct and informative outputs.\n",

      "Tianyi (Alex) Qiu, Zhonghao He, Hirokazu Shirado, Maarten Sap\n",
      "Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for *belief entrenchment* in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based *Martingale Score* to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term *belief entrenchment*. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.\n",

      "Uncertainty-aware meta-learning aims not only for rapid adaptation to new tasks but also for reliable uncertainty estimation under limited supervision. Neural Processes (NPs) offer a flexible solution by learning implicit stochastic processes directly from data, often using a global latent variable to capture functional uncertainty. However, we empirically find that variational posteriors for this global latent variable are frequently miscalibrated, limiting both predictive accuracy and the reliability of uncertainty estimates. To address this issue, we propose Test Time Scaling for Neural Processes (TTSNPs), a sequential inference framework based on Sequential Monte Carlo Sampler (SMCS) that refines latent samples at test time without modifying the pre-trained NP model. TTSNPs iteratively transform variational samples into better approximations of the true posterior using neural transition kernels, significantly improving both prediction quality and uncertainty calibration. This makes NPs more robust and trustworthy, extending applicability to various scenarios requiring well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.\n",

      "We interact with computers on an everyday basis, be it in everyday life or work, and many aspects of work can be done entirely with access to a computer and the Internet. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for both industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most competitive agent, 30% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems.

      "Measuring progress is fundamental to the advancement of any scientific field. As benchmarks play an increasingly central role, they also grow more susceptible to distortion.Chatbot Arena has emerged as the go-to leaderboard for ranking the most capable AI systems. Yet, in this work we identify systematic issues that have resulted in a distorted playing field. We find that undisclosed private testing practices benefit a handful of providers who are able to test multiple variants before public release and retract scores if desired. We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best score leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance results. At an extreme, we found one provider testing 27 private variants before making one model public at the second position on the leaderboard. We also establish that proprietary closed models are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models removed from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives. Both these policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. The top two providers have individually received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the arena. In contrast, a combined 83 open-weight models have only received an estimated 29.7% of the total data. With conservative estimates, we show that access to Chatbot Arena data yields substantial benefits; even limited additional data can result in relative performance gains of up to 112% on ArenaHard, a test set from the arena distribution.Together, these dynamics result in overfitting to Arena-specific dynamics rather than general model quality. The Arena builds on the substantial efforts of both the organizers and an open community that maintains this valuable evaluation platform. We offer actionable recommendations to reform the Chatbot Arena's evaluation framework and promote fairer, more transparent benchmarking for the field.\n",

We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one consistent framework we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner.We find RL combined with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these strategies.As a result, we release EARL: **E**diting with **A**utoregression and **RL**, a strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse range of edits compared to strong baselines with much more training data.

      "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for training language models (LMs) on reasoning tasks that elicit emergent long chains of thought (CoTs).Unlike supervised learning, it updates the model using both correct and incorrect samples via policy gradients.To better understand its mechanism, we decompose the learning signal into positive and negative sample reinforcement.Surprisingly, we find that training with only negative samples---without reinforcing correct responses---can be highly effective: it consistently improves performance over the base model across the entire Pass@$k$ spectrum, often matching or surpassing PPO and GRPO.In contrast, reinforcing only correct responses improves Pass@$1$ but degrades performance at higher $k$, due to reduced diversity.These inference-scaling trends highlight the critical yet underappreciated role of negative sample reinforcement (NSR) in improving LM reasoning. Through gradient analysis, we show that it works by suppressing incorrect generations and redistributing probability mass toward other plausible candidates, guided by the model's prior beliefs.It refines the model's existing knowledge, without learning new behaviors from scratch. Building on this insight, we propose a simple variant of the RL objective that upweights NSR, and show that it consistently improves overall Pass@$k$ performance on MATH, AIME 2025, and AMC23.\n",

      "LLaVA-style Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but struggle with factual recall tasks compared to their underlying language model (LM). While previous work attributes this to insufficient computational depth after visual processing, we provide an alternative explanation: the distributed representations of visual information across visual tokens in early layers bypasses the factual recall mechanism that resides in the early-layer MLPs of the LM backbone. The performance gap therefore stems from the architectural design of VLMs, rather than insufficient computational capacity.Using linear probes, we show that dedicated linear representations of visual information only emerge in the middle-to-late layers of VLMs. As a result, factual recall in VLMs becomes a “two-hop” challenge, where factual recall precedes visual processing, but the visual processing finishes too late in the model. Through comparative analysis, we demonstrate that successful factual recall depends on the speed of the first processing “hop.”To further support our hypothesis, we patch early-layer MLP outputs from the LM backbone into the corresponding VLM layers, significantly improving factual recall performance. This suggests that the absence of properly aligned token embeddings in early layers is a key factor in factual recall degradation. Finally, we introduce a benchmark to systematically evaluate factual recall accuracy and knowledge hallucination in multimodal settings.Our findings highlight a fundamental architectural limitation in current VLMs and pave the way for designing models that better integrate visual and linguistic information for reliable factual reasoning.\n",

      "There is growing concern over the safety of powerful diffusion models, as they are often misused to produce inappropriate, not-safe-for-work content or generate copyrighted material or data of individuals who wish to be forgotten. Many existing methods tackle these issues by heavily relying on text-based negative prompts or retraining the model to eliminate certain features or samples. In this paper, we take a radically different approach, directly modifying the sampling trajectory by leveraging a negation set (e.g., unsafe images, copyrighted data, or private data) to avoid specific regions of data distribution, without needing to retrain or fine-tune the model. We formally derive the relationship between the expected denoised samples that are safe and those that are unsafe, leading to our *safe* denoiser, which ensures its final samples are away from the area to be negated. We achieve state-of-the-art safety performance in large-scale datasets such as the CoPro dataset while also enabling significantly more cost-effective sampling than existing methodologies.\n",

We find that small and large models learn highly similar representation spaces, which motivates training expensive components like SAEs on a smaller model and transferring to a larger model at a FLOPs savings. For example, using a small-to-large transferred SAE as initialization can lead to 50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs on larger models. Next, we show that transferred probes and steering vectors can effectively recover ground truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into feature-level transferability, finding that semantic and structural features transfer noticeably differently while specific classes of functional features have their roles faithfully mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.\n",

Furthermore, when data are not representative due to selection bias, both disaggregated evaluation and alternative approaches based on conditional independence testing may be invalid without explicit assumptions regarding the bias mechanism. We use causal graphical models to predict metric stability across subgroups under different data generating processes. Our framework suggests complementing disaggregated evaluations with explicit causal assumptions and analysis to control for confounding and distribution shift, including conditional independence testing and weighted performance estimation.

We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve---though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

Despite the importance of speed and cost-effectiveness, prior works have utilized MLLMs as reward models, which poses significant constraints for real-world deployment. To address this, in this work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd which could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level.

      "Large language models (LLMs) are trained on a vast amount of human-written data, but data providers often remain uncredited. In response to this issue, data valuation (or data attribution), which quantifies the contribution or value of each data to the model output, has been discussed as a potential solution. Nevertheless, applying existing data valuation methods to recent LLMs and their vast training datasets has been largely limited by prohibitive compute and memory costs. In this work, we focus on influence functions, a popular gradient-based data valuation method, and significantly improve its scalability with an efficient gradient projection strategy called LoGra that leverages the gradient structure in backpropagation. We then provide a theoretical motivation of gradient projection approaches to influence functions to promote trust in the data valuation process. Lastly, we lower the barrier to implementing data valuation systems by introducing LogIX, a software package that can transform existing training code into data valuation code with minimal effort. In our data valuation experiments, LoGra achieves competitive accuracy against more expensive baselines while showing up to 6,500x improvement in throughput and 5x reduction in GPU memory usage when applied to Llama3-8B-Instruct and the 1B-token dataset.\n",

Our findings reveal that while model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent with significant outliers, highlighting that knowledge transfer is a distinct capability requiring dedicated optimization. Our analysis uncovers behavioral and strategic factors that mediate successful knowledge transfer, and we release our code, dataset, and evaluation framework to support future work on communicatively aligned models.\n",

      "Yutong Bai, Danny Tran, Amir Bar, Trevor Darrell, Yann LeCun, Jitendra Malik\n",
      "We train models to predict ego-centric video from human actions (PEVA), given the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the model’s embodied prediction and control abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with video prediction from the perspective of a human.\n",

      "Why and How LLMs Hallucinate: Connecting the Dots with Subsequence Associations\n",
      "Yiyou Sun, Yu Gai, Lijie Chen, Abhilasha Ravichander, Yejin Choi, Nouha Dziri, Dawn Song\n",
      "Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations—content that deviates from factually inaccurate or deviates from provided context—posing challenges for diagnosis. However, diagnosing the causes of hallucination is challenging due to the complex interplay of underlying causes. This paper introduces a framework to systematically understand the sources of hallucination behavior in large language models. Our key insight is that hallucinations arise when more frequent but non-factual associations outweigh faithful ones.Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that decoder-only transformers effectively function as subsequence embedding models, with the fully-connected layers encoding input-output associations. We propose a tracing algorithm that identifies causal subsequences by analyzing hallucination probabilities across randomized input contexts. Experiments show our method outperforms standard attribution techniques in identifying hallucination causes and is supported by evidence from the model’s training corpus. This work provides a unified perspective on hallucinations and a robust framework for their cause and analysis.\n",

      "Why Knowledge Distillation Works in Generative Models: A Minimal Working Explanation\n",
      "Sungmin Cha, Kyunghyun Cho\n",
      "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a core component in the training and deployment of modern generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs). While its empirical benefits are well documented—enabling smaller student models to emulate the performance of much larger teachers—the underlying mechanisms by which KD improves generative quality remain poorly understood.In this work, we present a minimal working explanation of KD in generative modeling. Using a controlled simulation with mixtures of Gaussians, we demonstrate that distillation induces a trade-off between precision and recall in the student model. As the teacher distribution becomes more selective, the student concentrates more probability mass on high-likelihood regions at the expense of coverage—a behavior modulated by a single entropy-controlling parameter.We then validate this effect in a large-scale language modeling setup using the SmolLM2 family of models. Empirical results reveal the same precision–recall dynamics observed in simulation, where precision corresponds to sample quality and recall to distributional coverage.This precision–recall trade-off proves especially beneficial in scenarios where sample quality outweighs diversity, such as instruction tuning or downstream generation. Our analysis provides a simple and general explanation for the effectiveness of KD in generative modeling.\n",
