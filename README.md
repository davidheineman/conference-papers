Goal: Find most top-K interesting papers.

Method: Filtering.

1) [`constants.py`](constants.py) filter by authors: 418 -> 109
2) [`filtered65.md`](filtered65.md) filter by reading TL;DRs: 109 -> 65
3) [`filtered20.md`](filtered20.md) filter by reading abstracts: 65 -> 20
4) [`final10.md`](final10.md) filter to papers I couldn't understand from only the abstract: 20 -> 10
